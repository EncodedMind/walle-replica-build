# WALL-E Replica Build üõ†Ô∏èü§ñ

This repository documents my personal build of the [WALL-E Replica Robot](https://wired.chillibasket.com/3d-printed-wall-e/), an open-source robotics project designed by [chillibasket](https://github.com/chillibasket). The original designs, code, and instructions belong to the creator, and this repository serves as a showcase of my assembly process and experience.

## üîç Overview

The WALL-E Replica Robot is a 3D-printed, microcontroller-powered robotic replica of the beloved WALL-E character. This repository highlights:
- My personal experience building the robot.
- Photos of the final product.
- Troubleshooting and tips I discovered during the process.

## üõ†Ô∏è What I Did

1. **3D Printing:**
   - Used a [`WANHAO Duplicator i3 Plus`](https://wanhao.store/products/wanhao-i3-plus-mkii) to create the parts based on the provided STL files.
   - Material: `PLA`.

2. **Assembly:**
   - Followed the assembly guide from the original repository.
   - Connected the microcontrollers and wired components as instructed.

3. **Challenges:**
   - Faced [e.g., alignment issues with X part, printer calibration problems].
   - Solved [e.g., part warping by increasing bed temperature, used alternative screws for better fit].

4. **Final Testing:**
   - Successfully tested movement, sounds, and other functionalities.

## üí° Tips and Notes

- If you‚Äôre building this, ensure you have access to a well-calibrated 3D printer, with proper leveling.
- Use yellow and grey filaments, or white - as I did - and paint using acrylic spray paint.
- Double-check the wiring diagrams before powering on the robot.
